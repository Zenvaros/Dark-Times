Meaning of the keys found in a graphic .ini file:

No corresponding ini file for a graphic : still image with default properties

if you have a need for a still image, but with some non defaults properties (like an offset or an opacity), then you just have to add the properties you want to change. (example: Solidity = 0)

otherwise, these various fields can be used:

Sprite
a deprecated field, no more used

Frame
# of frames of the graphic (default 1)

Facing
Must be 1 (Default), 4 or 8.
If 8 directions are specified, then they start with east and move in the trigonometrical order: E, NE, N, NW, W, SW, S, SE.
If only 4 faces are specified, then it will be NE, NW, SW and SE.

Animated
either 0 (no) or 1 (yes, default value).

Pace
Speed of anim, 100 being 100% speed (one graphic frame for each FPS of the rendering engine), 50% meaning half speed, etc. Between 1 and 100 (Default 100)

Solidity
Any pixel with an alpha level equal or above this value will be considered solid for hit test purpose. The default is 31, meaning that a pixel with an alpha of 30 or less is ignored for mouse events.
With his in addition to the transparency color, Magenta: RGB(255, 0, 255)

OffSetX
OffSetY
An offset when the image is displayed.

Preload
either 0 (no, default value) or 1 (yes).
Preemptive load of the texture by the cache.
